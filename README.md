Pradella
About the Project
Pradella is an application developed in response to a specific problem faced by teachers at a boarding school with strict, military-like regulations. Due to these rules, teachers often encounter significant difficulties and delays in obtaining permission to leave the school premises. The traditional process requires a written proposal and often depends on the physical presence of a superior for approval, which is not always feasible, especially in urgent situations.
The core purpose of Pradella is to digitize and streamline this permission-seeking process. The application is designed to create a more efficient and transparent system for both teachers and their superiors, ensuring that urgent and non-urgent requests can be processed promptly, regardless of the superior's location.


Features
Teacher Section
This section is accessible to users with a teacher account. It is designed to empower teachers by providing them with the necessary tools to manage their leave requests.
Proposal Submission: Teachers can create and submit new proposals by filling in required information such as the specific time period, the purpose of their outing, and the intended location and activities.
Submission History: A history log allows teachers to view the status of all their past and pending proposals, including whether they were approved, rejected, or are still awaiting a decision.
Account Management: Teachers can modify their personal account details, although these changes are subject to a superior's approval to maintain data integrity and security.

Superior Section
This section is exclusive to users with a superior account. It provides superiors with comprehensive control and oversight of all leave requests and teacher accounts.
Proposal Management: Superiors can view all submitted proposals from all teachers. They have the authority to make decisions on each proposal, either approving or rejecting it.
Detailed Submission Information: The platform provides detailed information for every proposal, enabling superiors to make informed decisions.
Full Account Control: Superiors have unrestricted access to modify any teacher's account details. This feature helps in maintaining accurate records and managing the user database.
Change Monitoring: Superiors can monitor any changes made by teachers to their personal accounts, ensuring that all information is verified and correct.


Technical Information
Development Environment
Programming Language: The application is built using the Java Programming Language, chosen for its object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities and cross-platform compatibility.
IDE: The development was done using NetBeans IDE, which provides a built-in Java GUI Builder that significantly accelerated the construction of the user interface.
Platform Independence: Since Java is platform independent, Pradella can be used on different operating systems, including Windows and macOS, which are the primary systems used at the school. This ensures the application is accessible to all faculty members, regardless of their device.


Project Rationale
The choice to develop an OOP-based application in Java was influenced by several factors. As an IB Computer Science student specializing in the OOP option, I possess a strong familiarity with Java, which reduced the development time. The platform independence of Java also addressed the need for a solution that could run on the diverse range of devices used by the school's staff. The use of NetBeans further enhanced efficiency by providing tools that simplified the creation of the graphical user interface.
