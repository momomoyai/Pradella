Mr. X is an IB History and Philosophy teacher and has become the client of this
development. Mr. Y is an IB Computer Science teacher that specifically teaches OOP options
and now becomes my advisor. Choosing both Mr. X and Mr. Y is decided based on the
consideration that Mr. X has an open-minded thinking as an IB Philosophy teacher, as he accepts
any type of solution to solve the problem that has been for years for teachers in the school. Mr. Y
is also recognised as a great IA advisor and an OOP expert.
In the boarding school where Mr. X teaches, there were several rules that kept Mr. X
stayed at the dorm and seldom went outside. As the school is also associated with the National
Air Force, the rules implemented are based on National Air Force regulations. These regulations
create difficulties in receiving permissions to leave the school which become a problem for
teachers, especially when the urgent situations won't tolerate the regulations implemented.
In order to receive permission to go outside the school, the teacher has to propose a
proposal, including specific time period, activities and places, ending by the reason lies on the
proposal. The teacher also has to receive the approval from the superior, which is not always
present. By addressing the problem, a product called Pradella is proposed to be developed in
order to help teachers in those situations, which is also based on the agreement from both Mr. X
and Mr. Y.
